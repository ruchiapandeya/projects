                    Paper Crown (www.papercrown.in) - enables a simple and efficient way to help users who look for books related to their coursework, academics, hobby etc.
                    in their locality by searching within a pools of books advertised by locales in their area. It may be your neighbour
                    who has a book which you need but just because you don't meet him freqently you don't know, and when you search your book,
                    www.papercrown.in lists the book and you can knock the door of your neighbour to grab it.
                </p>
                
                <p class="para2">
                    Anyone from an entrepreneur to one who hardly know what it means to sell a book, can use this forum to advertise the books which they
                    don't need it and someone in need can find it.<br>
                    The *real* value add here is your local area where you can find the books and contact them either personally, dial their number or meet at a common location to exchange,
                    which doesn't need formal process.

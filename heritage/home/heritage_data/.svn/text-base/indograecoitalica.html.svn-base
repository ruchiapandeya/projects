Ideas on an international cooperation project in Classics, Linguistics, History, 
Archaeology, and related topics, based in India. <br />
Andreas L. Katonis, University of Thessaloniki, Greece <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The underlying concept in proposing a workshop dealing with 
thetopic indicated in the title is that we face three cultured languages of 
highimportance, with their equally important heritage that has influenced 
theworld for many centuries, and which, still today, is operative in many <br />
instances. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The three languages in question are Sanskrit, Ancient Greek 
andLatin with their respective dimensions and influences. These languagesand 
cultures, having many features in common, have been studied bothindividually and 
in comparative approach. They are among the most important subject-matters of a 
discipline which is termed in our days Comparative Philology. The English usage 
traditionally distinguishes between Comparative Philology, Classical Philology 
and Classical Scholarship, although these labelings were never entirely firm or 
generally accepted. The present approach suggests to attribute to "Comparative 
Philology" mainly, but not exclusively, a linguistic tenor1, to"Classical 
Philology" the traditionalconcept of studying, interpreting anddrawing important 
conclusions from Greek and Latin authors and othertexts transmitted, and to the 
third one, also called Classics, a multidimensional approach to the ancient 
world, understood "classical", so that we comprehend it better in order to draw 
conclusions relevant to our world, with India, Greece and Italy in the 
foreground. 2 Though this suggestion does not aim at Comparative Philologyproper 
with its broad horizon, yet it argues in favour of a multi-faceted <br />
1 It is perhaps not unimportant to remark that this term is officially used in 
Oxford University where it covers the concept of Indo-European Studies in their 
complexity, i.e. studies beyond linguistics, though linguistically centered.2 
These terms exist more or less also in French and in Italian. In the German 
world, where often top-ranking results were attained, the <br />
equivalent of the first is 'Indogermanistik' (with emphasis on the languages and 
on linguistics), the second is 'Klassische Philologie', andthe third is 
'(Klassische) Altertumswissenschaft'. Only the first of thesecomprises Indology, 
which, naturally, exists also independently, interdisciplinarity. So that 
Indology is not excluded terminologically, the <br />
label "Indo-Graeco-Italica" is proposed. Informally, perhaps, also "Classics" 
could do this work since both this term and "Classical Philology" would suggest 
that the Indic tradition is not classical. Such aclaim, however, cannot be 
accepted. excluded terminologically, the label "Indo-Graeco-Italica" is 
proposed. Informally, perhaps, also "Classics" could do this work since both 
this term and "Classical Philology" would suggest that the Indic tradition is 
not classical. Such aclaim, however, cannot be accepted. <br />
<br />
The aim of this Indo-Graeco-Italica project is to express the respect that the 
present writer, like every classicist feels when engaged inthe three languages 
and cultures, respect which these, undeniably, deserve. The project is meant to 
be a bow to the classical world and to its study, to classical and comparative 
philology, and to everything and everyone interested in and searching into the 
past and trying to exploit itto the benefit of the present. During the last 
century, and increasingly inthe second half ot it, classical studies came under 
attack, in our view,unduly and pointlessly in many cases. To give an appropriate 
response aknowledge is necessary which, in our time, is often absent. To follow 
Wiseman3, scholars in other fields often express reservations, ranging from 
doubts to rejection with regard to both the importance of the classics and the 
value of linking linguistics to them. Only in the newmillennium do there seem to 
be some slight changes: regret for the lackof an education that rests on 
recognized values resulted in a belatedawareness. Using his words, we could, 
perhaps, hope that the "pendulum"has swung and Latin and Greek are popular 
again. Hopefully, this swingwill give a boost to the whole field. To be added: 
the interest and the respect for India never ceased to exist in the Western 
world.<br />
<br />
A valuable feature for comparative studies is the linguistic and thecultural 
continuity: today, the living successor languages are Hindi (aswell as other 
related tongues of India), and respectively, Modern Greekand Italian. Also, in 
the three respective countries, Italy, Greece and India,the spiritual heritage 
is still tangible. In this way, a main and a secondaryfocus for study may be 
suggested: the first should be the respective early and the classical periods, 
and the second the postclassical-medieval ones, and occasionally, modern times.<br />
<br />
The common features belong to two levels: the prehistoric or the Indo-European 
level (restricted to the first focus), and the historical one which may reach 
from antiquity down to our days. The matter of the firstdomain is the inherited 
features, and that of the second is the rich historyof relations between Greece 
and the Roman world, and those betweenGreece, Rome, the Byzantine Empire on the 
one hand, and India on the other. The inherited features cover a very broad 
area. They are most conspicuous in the languages the relationship of which is 
beyond anydoubt, although the relations are to be understood hierarchically, 
i.e.their degree is not the same everywhere. This is an issue linguistics is 3 
T.P. Wiseman (Ed), Classics in Progress. Essays on Ancient Greece and Rome 
(London: The British Academy 2002, see p. XV) capable of managing easily. We 
feature a fascinating branch of linguistics(traditionally: "philology") that has 
been studied extensively. This does not mean, however, that there aren't still 
several questions remaining tobe solved. In the spiritual domain, too, we meet 
very fascinating issues.The most important among them is, perhaps, mythology. No 
need to underline that disciplines like archaeology have an interdisciplinary 
dimension: to evaluate archaeological findings, history, philology, mythology, 
art and other fields are essential. There is a difficult but promising 
perspective for the cooperation between archaeology and linguistics to which I 
return below(traditionally: "philology") that has been studied extensively. This

which I return below.<br />
<br />
An "Indo-Graeco-Italica" Workshop could be realized in several forms: as a 
Summer School, as congresses held regularly, as universitycurricula. The easiest 
of attainment is, perhaps, a two week SummerSchool organized each year at a 
university with professors invited fromIndia and from other parts of the world. 
Since the classes are meant to be of a higher than undergraduate level, the 
prospective audiences couldconsist of doctorands, postgraduate students, and any 
interested academic, scholar or student who has an appropriate grounding. <br />
<br />
Topics <br />
<br />
Tentatively, the topics for such a project might be:<br />
<br />
- the importance of the Graeco-Roman tradition for Asia and for <br />
India (their cultivation), and the importance of Indology for Europe, forItaly, 
and for Greece respectively (the history of Indological studies inItaly, in 
Greece, and in Europe in general included).<br />
- roots and history of European and Indic thinking (philosophy) <br />
- the grammatical tradition in India <br />
- the grammatical tradition in Greece and Rome <br />
- aspects of common features in the three great traditions <br />
(similarities, contacts):<br />
- linguistic <br />
- prehistoric (archaeology, mythology) <br />
- historical (contacts in historical times) <br />
- study and comparison of literary works <br />
- a systematic investigation of the philosophical tradition in <br />
India and in Greece <br />
- comparison of works of art <br />
Connections <br />
<br />
<br />
At an advanced level, the three traditions and languages could beanalyzed in 
their linguistics and cultural contexts:analyzed in their linguistics and 
cultural contexts:<br />
<br />
- Greek in its historical context, Greek Linguistics <br />
-Greek Studies (what is now termed .........s.a <br />
in Greece) <br />
- Sanskrit in its historical context, Sanskrit, Indo-Iranian or Indo-<br />
Aryan Linguistics<br />
- Indology <br />
- Latin in its historical context, Latin and Italic Linguistics <br />
- Latin and Italic Studies <br />
- The linguistic and cultural environment of Greek, Sanskrit and <br />
Latin. This means prehistoric linguistic and cultural factors in three <br />
regions: in Greece, in Italy and in India, before Greek, Latin and 
Sanskritbecame dominant in their historical territories. <br />
The linguistic and the cultural aspects could be expanded into <br />
interdisciplinary directions:<br />
<br />
- linguistics and archaeology: a nineteenth century term suggested for the 
cooperation between the two disciplines is "linguistic palaeontology". Some 
scholars, however, prefer the modern "lexicocultural analysis". The technique 
requires an appeal to archaeological andpalaeo-environmental evidence to set 
broad limits on where and when a proto-language might have been spoken. This 
approach may interest both European and Indian linguists and archaeologists. 
Some difficultiescaused certain specialists in both fields to be cautious, and 
sometimesreserved. I would, however, remind that the linguist John Chadwick, 
whocontributed to M. Ventris' decipherment of Mycenaean Linear B, called, ina 
lecture given in the Academy of Vienna in 1975, "fatal" that gap whichdivided 
linguists and archaeologists and stood up for a cooperation.<br />
- classical philology and linguistics: the present writer thinks that these two 
fields represent sister disciplines which should cooperate <br />
seamlessly. Such a concept has a long tradition, most tangibly perhapsin 
Germany. The periodical Glotta shows a convincing concern.<br />
- history and philology: there is no need to underline the importance of 
literary sources for history <br />
- philology and literature,and <br />
- art and archaeology, are related fields. Their cooperation is <br />
supposed to bring mutually fruitful results. <br />
Special classes <br />
<br />
From time to time, special classes could be organized on some important and/or 
controversial theories or persons. Certainly, a course on G. Dumézil e.g. would 
not be inexpedient, to which French scholarsmight be invited, as well as 
opponents from other countries.might be invited, as well as opponents from other 
countries.<br />
<br />
Another interesting and important topic could be the Silk Road issue: this 
road-network connected the Eastern Roman world with India and China. It existed 
for about one thousand years, and along it multicultural centres developed, with 
many linguistic, religious and cultural records and monuments, Greek and 
Sanskrit included. Archaeology plays here a major role. With the exploration of 
this roadgreat names have been connected, like those of sir Aurel Stein, 
SvenHedin, and also of living American scientists.<br />
<br />
The Byzantine and Roman cultural and commercial presence in India (e.g. in 
Western Central India) is important and could serve as amaterial for many 
special classes. <br />
<br />
Prospects <br />
<br />
An important contribution could be a mediator function. As this writer has 
experienced, the respect and interest for each country among the three, and 
especially between India and the two European ones, exists, yet concrete 
knowledge as well as possibilities of study are restricted. Especially in Greece 
there are no systematic Sanskrit or Hindistudies, although this happens 
sometimes, and happened also in thepast. It would be very advisable that in the 
three countries both Graeco-Roman (Latin) and Indic studies existed. To this 
claim only Italy seems tocorrespond in a satisfactory way. <br />
&nbsp;A desirable positive outcome would be if, following the Workshop,classes 
of the three languages could be organized for the interested,either as part of 
university curricula or preparing more systematic universitiy classes of this 
kind. <br />

	<strong>The Power of Philology
 </strong> </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 “Philology” would comprise, in the broadest sense, language , and
language sciences . Linguistics would mainly, but not exclusively, deal with
the communicative and the spoken aspect of human language, and philology
would, in a somewhat narrower sense, mainly but not exclusively, deal with
written tradition as far as languages and cultures are concerned.
What I suggest here is a first draft and is open to discussion and to
further corrections, and also to future thinking. You are invited to answer
before you submit to the site anything final. It would be useful if you left the
site or link open for me for corrections and additions.
The basic idea is that, on the one side, there are cultured languages
and traditions (such as India with Sanskrit and its continuations, Greece with
Ancient Greek and its continuation down to our time, and Italy with Latin and
the modern Romance languages, mainly Italian), fields that can be
approached by philological investigation. On the other side there is language
as a major factor that made one of the animal beings of our planet into Man
or Human. Whereas the first, say, “philological” tradition takes an interest in
what is thought to be precious and classical, the second, say “linguistic”
tradition, does not evaluate: everything linguistic, even graffiti from the
antiquity or of our days, may be precious for linguistic considerations.
Language then, in this sense, takes you to linguistics proper, and, beyond
that, also as far as, e.g., to Cultural Anthropology, whereas philology , takes
you to text-centered considerations of tradition. Although philology, modern
philology comprised, is interested also in literature proper (the kind writers
and poets cultivate) and its criticism, I would like to leave this dimension – at
least what is not ancient in it - in the the background, because, first, such
large fields cannot be comprised in one, and, secondly, I am not at home in
literary criticism. Indeed, thirdly, most readers would not be interested; or,
the other way round, those who take an interest in literature proper would
not be interested in linguistics or in classical issues beyond classical
literature. (By the way: although literary criticism is not my first concern, I
have compared the important Indian rasa -theory with the Aristotelian
catharsis -concept. The word itself is very probably akin to Greek δρόσος
/drosos/, ‘dew’, ‘freshness’ and Slavic ‘rosa’ (similar).

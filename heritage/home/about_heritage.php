		     <h1>About Heritage Without Frontier</h1>
				    <p>Heritage without Frontiers is an open internet resource that endeavours to bring together the finest ideas, scholarship and happenings in the
				    areas of cultural and natural heritage.<br><br>
				    <h1>Mission</h1>
				    Heritage does have its physical manifestations, like the exquisite architecture of the Taj Mahal or the virgin forests of the Amazon.
				    At HeritagewithoutFrontiers, we go beyond the tangible to think of heritage as myriad expressions of quality and beauty unfettered by political
				    boundaries. These sensibilities have shaped human psyche for millenia. Recent finds suggest that early man crafted beads as far back as 200000
				    years before present. Did you know that certain tribes which live in the rain forests of south India hold the secrets of medicinal herbs?
				    Here is an instance of traditional knowledge gained by remote communities over time. We believe that knowledge about heritage and knowledge
				    that springs from heritage is crucial for a good quality of life. Though much of heritage is concerned with the past, its beauty is enjoyed in
				    the present, like walking around old waterfronts or wearing traditional textiles. Heritage also encompasses the natural world, the forests,
				    the threat of global warming, the need to preserve wildlife. Heritage gives us a sense of continuum and stability.
				    <br><br>
				    HeritagewithoutFrontiers is not merely an information platform. We seek to connect, interact and present knowledge about heritage in a way that is exciting,
				    rational and relevant.
				    <br><br>
				    HeritagewithoutFrontiers is organized in an open ended format, sustained by independent modules. A number of thematic and technical modules are being
				    planned. All modules shall be edited and presented by specialists in their field. The thematic modules shall explore broad heritage themes and academic
				    categories, like Indian Ocean Archaeology or Biodiversity. The technical modules will have a more professional focus, with an emphasis on "applicable"
				    ideas and information. Examples of technical modules are Salvage Archaeology, Conservation Architecture and Green Technologies.
